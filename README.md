# Cervical-Cancer
This study analyzed the publicly available UCI Cervical Cancer Risk Factors Dataset, which includes demographic, behavioral, and clinical variables commonly used for predicting cervical cancer risk.

The Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains data collected at the 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela, focusing on the prediction of cervical cancer indicators and diagnosis.
Here is a summary of its key characteristics:
•	Content: The dataset includes demographic information, lifestyle habits (such as smoking), and historic medical records for 858 patients.
•	Structure: It is a multivariate dataset with 858 instances and 36 attributes (features).
•	Data Types: The features consist of both integer and real values.
•	Missing Values: Yes, several patients declined to answer specific questions due to privacy concerns, resulting in missing data.
•	Target Variables: There are four target variables typically used for classification tasks: Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology, and Biopsy.
•	Key Features: Attributes include Age, Number of Sexual Partners, First Sexual Intercourse, Number of Pregnancies, Smoking habits, Hormonal Contraceptive use, IUD use, and various STD diagnoses.
This dataset is primarily used for classification tasks in the health and medicine domain, specifically to explore the correlation between risk factors and cervical cancer diagnosis.
